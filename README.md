# Fist Project: Part of Speech Tagging 

The HMM Tagger Notebook provides a way on how to build a hidden Markov model for part of speech tagging with a universal tagset. (From Udacity project) 

You can find more details in the Notebook HMM Tagger.ipynb


# Second Project: Machine learning Translation 

Apply the skills learnt in NLP to the challenging and extremely rewarding task of Machine Translation. 

Machine translation is a popular topic in research with new papers coming out every year. Over the years of research, different methods were created, like rule-based, statistical, and example-based machine translation. With all this effort, itâ€™s still an unsolved problem. However, neural networks have made a large leap forward in machine translation.

In this notebook, you will build a deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end machine translation pipeline. Your completed pipeline will accept English text as input and return the French translation. (From Udacity project) 


# Third project: Speech recognition 

Build a deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) pipeline! 
Using the Librispeech dataset: http://www.openslr.org/12/


Algorithm will first convert any raw audio to feature representations that are commonly used for ASR.
Build neural networks that can map these audio features to transcribed text. 
Learning about the basic types of layers that are often used for deep learning-based approaches to ASR. (From Udacity project) 

### Tasks are: 
-  Feature Extraction 
-  Create Acoustic Models
-  Decoder (prediction)
