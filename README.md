# Fist Project: Part of Speech Tagging 

The HMM Tagger Notebook provides a way on how to build a hidden Markov model for part of speech tagging with a universal tagset. (From Udacity project) 

You can find more details in the Notebook HMM Tagger.ipynb


# Second Project: Machine learning Translation 

Apply the skills learnt in NLP to the challenging and extremely rewarding task of Machine Translation. 

Machine translation is a popular topic in research with new papers coming out every year. Over the years of research, different methods were created, like rule-based, statistical, and example-based machine translation. With all this effort, itâ€™s still an unsolved problem. However, neural networks have made a large leap forward in machine translation.

In this notebook, you will build a deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end machine translation pipeline. Your completed pipeline will accept English text as input and return the French translation. (From Udacity project)
